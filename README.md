<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>

I used heavy amounts of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to build out a portfolio deemed unique to myself. 
It incorporates some of my experience, personality, and interests all in one website. This portfolio
will be updated with my most recent projects and activities. Lastly, I wanted to incorporate a simple activity 
using OpenWeatherMap's API to help show my dream vacation spot, its current weather, and allow the user to 
search up their favorite cities and see the current weather there, also. Majority of screen sizes should not 
affect the display of the portfolio, so it is mobile phone friendly!
